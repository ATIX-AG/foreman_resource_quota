# Foreman Resource Quota

When several users share a compute resource or infrastructure, there is a concern that some users could use more than its fair share of resources. Resource quotas are a tool for administrators to address this concern. They limit access to the shared resource in order to guarantee a fair collaboration.

Talking about Foreman, multiple users or groups usually share a fixed number of resources (limitation of compute resources like RAM, disk storage, and CPU power). As of now, a user cannot be limited when allocating resources. They can create hosts with as many resources as they want. This could lead to over-usage or unequal balancing of resources under the users. In order to prevent this, we want to introduce a new plugin: Foreman Resource Quota.

This plugin introduces the configuration of quotas. A quota limits specific resources and can be applied to a user or a user group. If a user belongs to a user group, the groupâ€™s quota is automatically applied to the user as well.

A user is hindered from deploying new hosts, if the new host would exceed the corresponding quota limits. In case, a user belongs to multiple user group with quota, the user can determine which quota new hosts belong to.
